    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Guinness beef stew is a very simple dish, but at the same time, it has a deep, complex, rich flavor. The maltiness of dark beer really does amazing things for the gravy. I served this in a nice ring of green onion-mashed potatoes. I hope you give this a try, whether for Saint Patrick's Day or any time of the year.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>This are the ingredients you're going to need to make this recipe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bacon:</strong> This Guinness stew starts with bacon. You'll use the bacon and the bacon fat to cook the beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Beef:</strong> Cut your boneless beef chuck into 2-inch pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings and herbs:</strong> This flavorful beef stew is seasoned with salt, black pepper, fresh garlic, white sugar, and fresh thyme.</li>
        <li><strong>Beer:</strong> Of course, you'll need a can of dark beer (such as Guinness).</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> This chunky Guinness stew features onions, carrots, and celery.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato paste:</strong> Tomato paste adds richness and flavor depth.</li>
        <li><strong>Stock:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade broth. You can use chicken or beef stock.</li>
        <li><strong>Mashed potatoes:</strong> Mashed potatoes are optional, but they make a great bed for the Guinness stew.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    Once you have the ingredients, these are the steps to make the best homemade lasagna:
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the bacon. Transfer the bacon to a stew pot, but leave the fat in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook the beef cubes in the fat. Place the browned beef in the stew pot.</li>
        <li>Cook the onions and garlic in the fat. Pour the beer in and stir.</li>
        <li>Transfer the contents of the skillet to the pot. Add the remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li> Simmer until the meat is tender, then bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Serve in bowls or over mashed potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
